Screen Navigation
------------------

C-v scroll upwards
M-v scroll downwards
C-l rotate current cursor position around screen
C-u lines <C-v|A-v>
C-a , e begin/end of line


C- p , n, f , b : navigate between characters and lines
A- f, b : navigate between words sand sentences
A- a, e : begin/end of sentence

Editing
----------

1. Repeat command C-x z
2. Deleting

Use Kill cycle buffer

C-y and repeat M-y to access previous kills. Only kills are available in the
kill buffer.


Buffers:

C-x C-b : list bufffers
C-x b <buffer name> : to open buffer
C-x s : save particular buffer

C-x 4 C-f : open file in new window
C-x 4


In general :

C-x = character extended commands
M-x = name extended commands

Search

C-s / C-r and repeat commands to goto next matching string
Esc C-s / Esc C-r = for regexp
M-x list-matching-lines
M-x query-replace-regexp

The answer is that you need to insert a ^J character, which Emacs uses to represent newlines in functions and commands. At the point in the regexp or replacement where you need to insert a newline, hit Ctrl-q followed by Ctrl-j. Ctrl-q is Emacs's "quote" command: rather than executing the following keystroke, Emacs will insert the key into the current buffer or the minibuffer.
